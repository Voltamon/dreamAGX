# FIXING THE INFINITE MIRROR EFFECT

## The Problem:
The hologram display is capturing itself, creating an infinite loop of displays within displays.

## The Solution:

**You have TWO OPTIONS:**

### Option 1: Use Dual Monitors (BEST)
If you have 2 monitors:
1. The hologram app now appears on **PRIMARY monitor** (Monitor 1)
2. It captures from **SECONDARY monitor** (Monitor 2)
3. Put your Discord/content on the **SECONDARY monitor**
4. The hologram on primary won't capture itself!

✅ **This is now configured automatically**

### Option 2: Use Region Selection
If you only have 1 monitor, use the R key:
1. Run the app
2. Press **R** key
3. Select ONLY your Discord window (not the hologram window)
4. Press ENTER
5. Now it only captures Discord, not itself!

---

## Quick Fix:
The app is now set to display on your PRIMARY monitor while capturing from SECONDARY. 

**Your setup should be:**
- PRIMARY monitor (left/main) → Hologram display window
- SECONDARY monitor (right/secondary) → Your Discord/content

This prevents the recursive capture!
